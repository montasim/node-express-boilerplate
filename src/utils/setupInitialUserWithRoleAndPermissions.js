/**
 * @fileoverview Initial System Setup Utility for Role-Based Access Control in Node.js Applications.
 *
 * This module contains a critical setup function intended for use during the initialization phase of an application,
 * or when resetting to default configurations. It automates the creation of essential roles, permissions, and a super
 * admin user within the system, laying the foundation for role-based access control (RBAC) and secure system management.
 *
 * The setup process encompasses several key operations:
 * 1. Creation of a predefined list of permissions essential for system operation, ensuring these permissions are
 *    available in the database for role assignments.
 * 2. Establishment of 'Admin' and 'Super Admin' roles, each associated with the full set of permissions, to delineate
 *    different levels of system access and control.
 * 3. Verification of the existence of a super admin user account, with automatic creation if such an account does not
 *    exist, ensuring there's always a user with the highest level access for system administration tasks.
 * 4. Option to send a verification or notification email to the super admin upon account creation, facilitating
 *    immediate engagement with the system.
 *
 * This function is designed to be executed as part of the application's startup sequence or through a dedicated setup
 * script, encapsulating complex initialization logic into a single, manageable operation. By automating these steps,
 * the utility supports a smooth and secure start-up and configuration process for applications implementing robust
 * access control and user management features.

/**
 * Asynchronously sets up initial roles, permissions, and a super admin user in the system. This setup function is
 * critical for initializing the application with a predefined set of permissions and roles, and ensuring that a
 * super admin user exists with all permissions assigned.
 *
 * The function performs the following operations in sequence:
 * 1. Create a list of permissions if they do not already exist in the database.
 * 2. Ensures that the 'Admin' and 'Super Admin' roles exist with all the created permissions.
 * 3. Checks for the existence of a super admin user and creates one if it doesn't exist, assigning the 'Super Admin'
 *    role to this user.
 * 4. Optionally, send a verification email to the super admin user upon creation.
 *
 * This function is typically called during the application's initial setup phase or when resetting the system to its
 * default state.
 *
 * @throws {Error} Throws an error if any part of the setup process fails, logging the error and rethrowing it for
 *                 higher-level error handling.
 * @example
 * setupInitialUserWithRoleAndPermissions()
 *   .then(() => console.log('Initial setup completed successfully.'))
 *   .catch(error => console.error('Failed during initial setup:', error));
