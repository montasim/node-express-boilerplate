/**
 * @fileoverview Custom Error Class for Handling Server Errors in Node.js Applications.
 *
 * This module defines a custom error class, `ServerError`, extending the native JavaScript `Error` class,
 * designed to provide a structured approach to error handling within server-side applications. By incorporating
 * additional properties such as `status` and `isOperational`, this class allows for more nuanced error
 * management, facilitating the differentiation between operational errors (which are part of the application's
 * normal functioning) and programmer errors (bugs).
 *
 * The `ServerError` class includes:
 * - `status`: An HTTP status code that indicates the nature of the error to clients, enhancing the
 *   interoperability and clarity of server responses.
 * - `isOperational`: A boolean indicating whether the error is an operational error, thereby helping in decision-making
 *   processes for logging, retries, and user notifications.
 * - Custom stack trace management: While the class captures the stack trace by default (if not provided), it also
 *   offers the flexibility to accept a custom stack trace, aiding in debugging and error analysis.
 *
 * This class is intended for use throughout the application wherever error handling is required, particularly
 * in API responses, middleware, and asynchronous operations. To ensure consistent and meaningful error information
 * is available both for the end-users and for system logging purposes.

/**
 * Represents a server-related error, extending the built-in Error class with additional
 * properties to aid in handling and reporting errors within a server or web application context.
 * This custom error class allows for specifying an HTTP status code and an operational flag
 * to distinguish between operational errors (anticipated errors that are part of the application's
 * normal functioning) and programmer errors (bugs). The class also optionally accepts a stack trace,
 * allowing for the provision of a custom stack trace or the automatic capture of the stack trace
 * at the point of instantiation.

     * @param {number} status The HTTP status code associated with this error, indicating
     *                            the nature of the error in the context of HTTP requests.
     * @param {string} message The error message that describes the error. This message is passed
     *                         to the base Error class constructor and is accessible via the `message` property.
     * @param {boolean} [isOperational=true] A flag indicating whether the error is operational,

     *                            the ServerError is instantiated.
